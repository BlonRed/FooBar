# FooBar
Test task Foo Bar
This project implements 4 variants of the FooBar test job implementation.
The first variant is usual.
The second variant with fewer branches.
The third variant without loop, recursive. 
The fourth variant is implemented through the switch operator.

The implementation of the console application itself is located in the FooBarMain class.
It checks values before passing them to methods and selects task implementations from 1 to 4.
